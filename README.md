## What is JSX?
JSX (JavaScript Extension) is a syntax extension for JavaScript and is used to describe what the UI should look like. Essentially, JSX is a React extension that that allows you to write JavaScript that *looks* like HTML. For example, you have a situation where you need to render multiple HTML elements combined together from you JavaScript application. If you had to write the ```React.createElement()``` for each and every one of those elements, it would very bothersome.

Here are a few questions from the study to explore:

## What is Babel
To enable JSX, you need to first use Babel, which is a transpiler used to convert edge ECMAScript 2015+ into backwards compatible versions of JavaScript (i.e. < ES5 )in older browsers and environments. A transpiler (i.e. sourse-to-source compiler) is a tool that reads source code written in one programming lnagugae and produce the equivalent code in another language at the same level. Unlike compiling (which converst one language to another at a *lower* abstraction level), transpiling converts one language to another at the same level (e.g. typescript == JavaScript or SAASS == CSS).
